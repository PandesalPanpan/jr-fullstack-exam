# Junior Fullstack Developer Exam

Welcome to my repository for the Junior Fullstack Exam. This web application is built using the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Python Dictionary
- **Frontend**: React.js, Bootstrap
- **Utilities**: fastapi-cors, uvicorn, react-router-dom, python-jose

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer before starting the project:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)


## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/PandesalPanpan/jr-fullstack-exam.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
```
cd jr-fullstack-exam
```
‚ùó **You will need two terminals to run backend and frontend**
### Running Backend
1. **Navigate to the Backend**
```
cd backend
```
2. **Active Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies**
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Start Backend**
```
fastapi dev main.py
```
If the "Serving at" is not running on the port 8000. You will have to match frontend apiBaseUrl at `config.js`


### Running Frontend
1. **Navigate to the Frontend**
```
cd frontend
```
2. **Install Dependencies**
```
npm install
```
3. **Start Frontend**
```
npm start
```

## Explanation of my Approach
The project structure in frontend is designed to maintain organization amd modularity

- **components/**: Contains reusable react components that is inserted it pages
- **hooks/**: Contains functions that add functionality to React components.
- **pages/**: Includes React view pages, which are routed to using React Router and built using components.
- **utils/**: Contains `auth.js` & `validation.js` files, as helper modules that are used by multiple components.

I implemented basic authentication with login and logout features using JSON Web Token. However, I wasn't able to integrate token verification into my API endpoints within the given time.

I have not included comments in the code, as I believe that clear naming conventions for files, functions, and variables serve as effective documentation, with exceptions made only for complex code that requires further abstraction. Prettier Code Formatter is used for consistent formatting.
